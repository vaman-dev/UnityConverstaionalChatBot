    ///         This guard exists because of a real failure. An EditMode test blocked the main thread
    ///         in <c>Assert.ThrowsAsync</c> waiting for an observer whose timeout was a ten
    ///         millisecond <c>Task.Delay</c>. The measurement that explains it:
    ///         <c>SynchronizationContext.Current</c> inside an EditMode test — synchronous or async —
    ///         is <c>UnityEngine.UnitySynchronizationContext</c>, and a continuation posted to it runs
    ///         only when the editor loop pumps. Blocking the main thread stops that pump, so the
    ///         continuation the block is waiting for can never arrive. The editor hung with zero CPU,
    ///         produced no report, named no test, and had to be killed.
    ///     </para>
    ///     <para>
    ///         An <c>await</c> in the test's own body is safe, because the test framework returns to
    ///         the editor loop between resumptions — which is why hundreds of tests await
    ///         <c>Task.Delay</c> without trouble. What is not safe is a <em>nested</em> blocking wait
    ///         on a task that is already in flight: whether it returns is decided by whoever completes
    ///         it, and if that completion is posted rather than inline, the wait never ends.
    ///     </para>
    ///     <para>
    ///         So the rule is narrow on purpose. Asserting on a call made right there
    ///         (<c>Assert.ThrowsAsync&lt;T&gt;(() =&gt; Api.RejectAsync(...))</c>) stays allowed — a
