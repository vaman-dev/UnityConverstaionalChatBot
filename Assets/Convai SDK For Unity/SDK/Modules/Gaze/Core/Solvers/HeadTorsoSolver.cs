        // dead-band latch on the goal in front of a transparent rate limiter, with a pursuit
        // classifier deciding when the latch stood aside. Measured on the real head bone under a
        // moving camera, that was the whole "stepped" feel: at 4 °/s the head parked for a
        // dozen frames at a time and caught up in 10 °/s bursts (a dead band is stick–slip by
        // definition, and every release was a velocity step the limiter executed at its
        // acceleration cap); at 55 °/s it stood still for the classifier's 0.12 s and then
        // overshot the target's rate by a quarter closing the band gap; at 1 Hz it reproduced a
        // hand-shaken camera with unit gain, because a transparent filter has no bandwidth and
        // the only thing left shaping the motion was the cap, which is bang-bang.
        //
        // So the following lane is now a PursuitTracker: critically damped, with a bounded
